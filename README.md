For recommendations of posts – I have used two simple approaches.
1.	Using a similarity matrix for various data points – some of the data points (for text – status , title, content , interest , item_name , user.username ) are vectorized using TF-IDF , other data points (integer or float – category , item_unit_price) used as it is. Further, each record transformed into a simple vector by concatenating above mentioned transformed data points. Similarity matrix (NxN , N being the number of records) is created applying simple cosine similarity on vectorized records. For the search item (post) - similarity scores against all other items (posts) is extracted. Items (posts) with highest scores are shown.
2.	Similarity score is calculated this time using the BERT embedding for item_name only. No other data points are used. In the recommendation item (posts) are shown which are similar to item_name of search item.
